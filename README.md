# alu-AirBnB_clone

## project summary🗒️


This is a clone of the AirBnb website. This project will only be a simple server copy of the real AirBnb website. However, the cloned website will implement the client side (front-end), and the server side (APIs, database, etc.)

This current project will only be implemented on the console or command interpreter. 

### command interpreter 🖥️

 The console functions similarly to a Shell, but with limitations tailored to specific use cases. Its purpose is to execute commands on project objects. These commands encompass various actions, such as:

- Generating a new object, such as a User or a Place
- Retrieving an object from sources like files or databases
- Performing operations on objects, such as counting or computing statistics
- Modifying attributes of an object
- Removing an object
- Exiting the interpreter.

### To initiate the interpreter 🤖

To initiate it, run:

```python
$./console.py
```
### using an interpreter 🔛

Here are the instructions for using the interpreter:

| Command | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `help` | Displays a list of documented commands | `(hbnb) help` |
| `help create (any command)` | Creates an object of a specified class | `(hbnb) help create` |
| `quit` | Exits the command interpreter | `(hbnb) quit` |
| `EOF` | Terminates the program | `(hbnb) EOF` |
| `all` | Shows all objects of a specified class | `(hbnb) all <class>` |
| `show` | Displays an object of a specified class | `(hbnb) show <class> <id>` |
| `update` | Modifies an object of a specified class | `(hbnb) update <class> <id> <attribute name> <"attribute value">` |
| `destroy` | Deletes an object of a specified class | `(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>` |
